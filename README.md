## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs



## Optimizations
*(optional)*

This project could have been optimized to include not only UPC 12 barcodes but UPC 13 barcodes well. Additionally the CSS could have been a bit more appealing but, I chose to focus on functionality rather than appearance. I could have added additional features to check to see if the product entered is vegan  or not, if it includes gluten, or even if it includes some sort of product that the user is allergic to.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first time really delving deep into APIs this project is really opened my eyes as far as the amount of stuff you can do with API's and data. I'm really excited to begin exploring it more. I've got the opportunity to play a bit more with DOM manipulation and  objects as well.
